# TumpangSG
This is a (WIP) personal project that I am trying to create and also at a same time learn NextJS and get back into writing in my favourite language TypeScript!

The idea of this project is to match request from people that wants to buy something with people that could be near the place to buy it. It could be a meal, a bubble tea, a very specific item that only a certain place has it.

So think there has to be some incentive to motivate people to help, so it could a few dollars offer to help compensate for the task. 

It could be that I am going to dabao (takeaway) food in a nearby hawker and I can take a look if there are any requests from my neighbors that also would like to get lunch from there or nearby. I could help them up for a small fee.

Could also be that I can help my neightbors purchase an item that is near my workplace but isn't really convinence for him/her.
